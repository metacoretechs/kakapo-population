# Chart of population of the k훮k훮po in New Zealand

This script is R code to generate an SVG chart of the population of k훮k훮po, an endangered New Zealand parrot, each year from 1977 to the present.

Population data is from https://www.doc.govt.nz/our-work/monitoring-reporting/, updated in October each year with the Annual Report of the Department of Conservation Te Papa Atawhai.

To update, add the new data values at the end of the vectors in the data frame, and run the code in R or RStudio
